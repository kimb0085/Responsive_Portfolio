			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img class="profile" src="assets/images/img_0560.jpg">
			<p>Some words that describe me include: volunteer (Open Your Heart to the Hungry and Homeless, pet parent (cat - Ruby, pug - Winston, traveler (still so much to explore), lover of all things: food (the list of what I don't like is shorter), craft beer (seasonal, local), and donut (need I say more?), aunt to a tiny human named Declan (he's got to be about 2 feet tall now), bibliophile (the books I enjoy range in all genres, exception: science fiction and the like), homeowner (condo, near Lake Calhoun, please never ask me to paint or de-popcorn ceilings, I've done it and hate it), and a full-time work from home (which brings it's joys and challenges).</p>

			<p>Clearly a fan of lists, I am a Project Manager for UnitedHealthcare working on a software install. My jobs have run the gamut of industry, but largely been contained to managing projects or change. I've found that coding provides me an opportunity to create, which is something I never knew I needed. It is challenging, frustrating, but yields something tangible, which isn't always so concrete in project management. So, I'm starting to really love it.</p>
